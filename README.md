## About
This little device was created by Lucia Wong as a portable emergency USB charging device in outdoor situations. The goal was to make it universally applicable and high powered enough to charge both old and new smartphones as well as small usb devices like Arduinos-- but still be small, DIY friendly, portable, foldable, and affordable--- using parts that can be easily sourced. 

Requested by a working professor in Kenya, a pdf blueprint for open source distribution will be created when the project is finalized.
